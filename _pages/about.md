I am currently a young researcher in [ADLab](https://pjlab-adg.github.io/) at [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/). I earned my Master's degree from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2022, where I was a member of the [APRIL Lab](https://april.zju.edu.cn/) under the mentorship of Dr. [Yong Liu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/yongliu). Prior to this, I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree at [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/).

My research interests focus on image-based and LiDAR-based perception and scene understanding for autonomous driving. Recently, I have been exploring the application of multi-modal large models in the field of autonomous driving.

Feel free to drop me emails (yangxuemeng@pjlab.org.cn) if you have similar interests on above topics.
